                    The Raccoon Police Department, commonly abbreviated as "RPD", is a municipal law enforcement
                    agency which served Raccoon City in Arklay County, United States.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Raccoon Police Department was established in 1969, when the then-city's rapid expansion
                    necessitated a dedicated police force beyond the Arklay County Sheriff's Department (ASD). Raccoon's
                    art museum, which had closed down, was purchased by the RPD the same year to be used as their base
                    of operations, the Raccoon Police Station.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When Mayor Michael Warren began preparation for the "Bright Raccoon 21" project in the early 1990s,
                    the force received extra funding from various local companies, including Umbrella USA, who wanted
                    assurances the RPD could deal with the increasing crime rate and the threat of domestic terrorism.
                    From this funding, the Special Tactics and Rescue Service was established.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During the 1990s, the RPD was under the control of Chief Brian Irons, who received monthly bribes
                    from Umbrella USA to keep the company's illegal activities from being investigated. Following the
                    events of the Mansion Incident, Irons barred investigation into Umbrella at the direct request of
                    Dr. Birkin, causing the surviving members of S.T.A.R.S. to organize their own private investigation
                    of the company and the Chief.
                </p>
