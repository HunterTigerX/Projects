                <p>Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For example:</p>
                <code><xmp>
           >>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
           Please enter an integer: 42
           >>> if x < 0:
           ...     x = 0
           ...     print('Negative changed to zero')
           ... elif x == 0:
           ...     print('Zero')
           ... elif x == 1:
           ...     print('Single')
           ... else:
           ...     print('More')
           ...
           More
                </xmp></code>
                <p>There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional. The keyword ‘elif’ is short for
           ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An if … elif … elif … sequence is a
           substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages.

           If you’re comparing the same value to several constants, or checking for specific types or
           attributes, you may also find the match statement useful. For more details see match Statements.</p>

                <p>The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than
           always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the
           ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement
           iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the
           sequence. For example (no pun intended):</p>
                <code><xmp>
           >>> # Measure some strings:
           ... words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
           >>> for w in words:
           ...     print(w, len(w))
           ...
           cat 3
           window 6
           defenestrate 12
        </xmp></code>
                <p>Code that modifies a collection while iterating over that same collection can be tricky to get right.
           Instead, it is usually more straight-forward to loop over a copy of the collection or to create a
           new collection</p>
                <code><xmp>
           # Create a sample collection
           users = {'Hans': 'active', 'Éléonore': 'inactive', '景太郎': 'active'}
               
           # Strategy:  Iterate over a copy
             for user, status in users.copy().items():
                if status == 'inactive':
                    del users[user]
               
           # Strategy:  Create a new collection
             active_users = {}
             for user, status in users.items():
               if status == 'active':
                   active_users[user] = status
                   </xmp></code>

        <section class="main-section" id="the_range_function">
            <header id="range_Section"><h2>the range function</h2>            </header>
                <p>If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function range() comes in handy.
           It generates arithmetic progressions:</p>
                <code><xmp>
           >>> for i in range(5):
           ...     print(i)
           ...
           0
           1
           2
           3
           4
        </xmp></code>
                <p>The given end point is never part of the generated sequence; range(10) generates 10 values, the legal
           indices for items of a sequence of length 10. It is possible to let the range start at another
           number, or to specify a different increment (even negative; sometimes this is called the ‘step’):
                </p>
                <code><xmp>
           >>> list(range(5, 10))
           [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
           
           >>> list(range(0, 10, 3))
           [0, 3, 6, 9]
           
           >>> list(range(-10, -100, -30))
           [-10, -40, -70]
        </xmp></code>

        <section class="main-section" id="break_and_continue_statements">
            <header id="break_Sectiion"><h2>break and continue statements</h2>            </header>
                <p>The break statement, like in C, breaks out of the innermost enclosing for or while loop.

           Loop statements may have an else clause; it is executed when the loop terminates through exhaustion
           of the iterable (with for) or when the condition becomes false (with while), but not when the loop
           is terminated by a break statement. This is exemplified by the following loop, which searches for
           prime numbers:</p>
                <code><xmp>
           >>> for n in range(2, 10):
           ...     for x in range(2, n):
           ...         if n % x == 0:
           ...             print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)
           ...             break
           ...     else:
           ...         # loop fell through without finding a factor
           ...         print(n, 'is a prime number')
           ...
           2 is a prime number
           3 is a prime number
           4 equals 2 * 2
           5 is a prime number
           6 equals 2 * 3
           7 is a prime number
           8 equals 2 * 4
           9 equals 3 * 3
                </xmp></code>
                <p>
           <ul class="extra__list">
               <li>
               </li>
               <li> 
                   (Yes, this is the correct code. Look closely: the else clause belongs to the for loop, not the if
                   statement.)
               </li>
               <li class="special">
                   When used with a loop, the else clause has more in common with the else clause of a try statement
           than it does with that of if statements: a try statement’s else clause runs when no exception
           occurs, and a loop’s else clause runs when no break occurs.

               <li>
                   The continue statement, also borrowed from C, continues with the next iteration of the loop:

                <p>
           The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the
           program requires no action. For example:
                </p>
                <code><xmp>
           >>> while True:
           ...     pass  # Busy-wait for keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)
           ...
                </xmp></code>
                <p>
           This is commonly used for creating minimal classes:
                </p>
                <code><xmp>
           >>> class MyEmptyClass:
           ...     pass
           ...
                </xmp></code>
                <p>
           Another place pass can be used is as a place-holder for a function or conditional body when you are
           working on new code, allowing you to keep thinking at a more abstract level. The pass is silently
           ignored:
                </p>
                <code><xmp>
           >>> def initlog(*args):
           ...     pass   # Remember to implement this!
           ...
                </xmp> </code>
